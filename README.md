## Why FairShare?
- A crowdfunding and investment platform has been developed to make **funding more accessible to women and encourage gender lens investing**.
- Only 15% of women received capital from venture capitalists in recent years and the growth rate of funding for female-founded companies has plateaued. Women entrepreneurs face greater challenges in accessing financial capital than men.
- **Crowdfunding** is a viable alternative for women entrepreneurs as trustworthiness is an important factor and people are more likely to **support female entrepreneurs**.
- **Gender lens scores** should be included in companies' weighting in indices, including ESG-based indices. **As female-run startups generated 78 cents in revenue for every dollar of investment raised**, outperforming their male counterparts despite raising less money.

## What it is capable of?
1. **Crowdfunding:** FareShare is a crowdfunding platform (both equity and reward) for women-led businesses who seek alternative funding and an investment gateway for gender lens investing.
2. **Gender Lens Investing Gateway:** Apart from investing in crowdfunding campaigns, investors are given avenues to diversify their investment via the gender equality funds list(source: Gender Equality Funds.org, which is ranked by gender equality scores).
3. **Gender Toolkit:** The app has a gender lens toolkit with three features:
    - Gender Lens Scorecard Test
    - Investor Risk Profiler
    - Media Analyzer using Natural Language Processing
4. **Benchmarking (Gender Equality Funds and Equity Index):** The Gender Lens Mutual Fund features a list of mutual funds with their performances over the years and ranked based on the gender lens score. Meanwhile, the Gender Lens Equity compares Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (the only one in the world) outperforming other global benchmarks such as the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI).
5) **Dashboard and Login:** The dashboard keeps track of and updates the user's crowdfunding campaigns and investments. The user can log in securely using an encrypted password or Google login.
